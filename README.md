In this project, we try to predict Colombian students' scores based on their socioeconomic profile.
For this, we use 3 supervised machine learning techniques: linear regressions, a softmax classifier (one-layer perceptron) and multi-layer perceptrons of different architectures. 
We achieved an accuracy of approx. 70% from a simple 1 hidden layer perceptron. The classification of the scores is made in accordance to the government's standards.

The data used is openly available from the ICFES website (used data from 20221): https://www.icfes.gov.co/repositorio-de-investigaciones.
